# GitHub Repository Rename

## Current Name
`aztec-auction-analysis`

## Recommended New Names

1. **`polymarket-trading-toolkit`** (Recommended)
   - Clear, descriptive
   - Reflects the main use case
   - Easy to find

2. **`aztec-polymarket-tools`**
   - Shows both projects
   - Bit long but complete

3. **`prediction-market-toolkit`**
   - More generic
   - Could include other markets in future

## How to Rename on GitHub

### Option 1: Via GitHub Website
1. Go to: https://github.com/b1rdmania/aztec-auction-analysis
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Repository name**
4. Change to new name
5. Click **Rename**

GitHub automatically redirects old URLs to new ones! ✅

### Option 2: Via Command Line
```bash
# Update your local remote
cd ~/PolymarketTests/aztec-auction-analysis
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/b1rdmania/NEW-NAME.git
```

## What Happens After Rename

### ✅ GitHub Handles Automatically
- Old URLs redirect to new repo
- All issues, PRs, stars preserved
- Existing clones still work

### ⚠️ You Need to Update
- Vercel deployment (if hardcoded)
- Any documentation with repo URLs
- README badges (if any)
- Local folder name (optional)

## Recommended Action

**Rename to**: `polymarket-trading-toolkit`

This accurately reflects that the project is:
1. Primarily a Polymarket trading system
2. With Aztec auction analysis as a component
3. A complete toolkit (multiple tools/packages)
